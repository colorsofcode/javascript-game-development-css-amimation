<!-- ABOUT -->
## About The Project

Small example showing how you can make game sprite animations using CSS with Javascript movement.

All of the game logic happens in the `game.js` file.

All of the CSS animation (exept states) is in the `duck/duck.styles.css`

You use keyboard `A W S D` navigation to move around 

PS. the images are hosted on firebase to make the demo work on StackBlitz
